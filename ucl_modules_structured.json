      "notes": " Focus on the core principles and basic examples. Having read those pages, your understanding and assimilation of organic chemistry lectures should be much improved than it would otherwise be, as should be your examination performance. Self-study in organic chemistry is essential in order to master the material. The lectures define and explain the topics, but form only the first part of your learning. You must practise example questions, including quiz and tutorial questions, and additional questions available on Moodle as soon as you have received the lectures in each week. Reading and practising questions identifies concepts that you find difficult, and which you can then ask your tutor to explain. Later, attempting past exam questions will be another key means of monitoring your progress."
